    <p>
        Notifications and Communications from Our Site
    </p>
    <p>
        Realty Mogul will send you email notifications from time to time. Some notifications are required elements of your transactions on our platform, such as confirmations of particular actions you have taken. These mandatory notices are sent typically to
        notify you of a change in status. For example, you will receive a notice when you are confirmed as an investor.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also send out notices that are required for legal or security purposes. For example, certain notifications are sent for your own protection to ensure that another person cannot make a change to your account without your knowledge. In other cases, these
        notifications involve changes to various legal agreements or Site policies. Generally, you may not opt out of such service-related emails.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you register as an investor, you will receive emails that confirm specific actions you requested. These will include emails to which you must respond to complete your registration and notifications confirming your registration. Thereafter, you will
        receive emails when a new investment opportunity is offered, as well as updates concerning the progress of the funding of such offering and/or other relevant information. If you make an investment through the Site, Realty Mogul or North Capital
        will also send you confirmations of the investment as well as occasional updates as to the status of that investment and the timing of distributions relating to that investment.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may also send you responses to emails you send us, if appropriate. From time to time, we will also send user surveys, requests for user feedback regarding user experience and Site operations, or marketing offers from us or from us on behalf of our
        marketing partners. Completing these surveys, answering requests for feedback, or accepting any offer is strictly voluntary. If you do not wish to receive these surveys, user feedback emails, and/or marketing offers, please opt out in any offer
        email you receive from us.

    <strong>Links to Other Sites</strong>
    <p>
        If you follow any links that direct you away from the Site, this privacy policy will not apply to your activity on the other websites you visit. We do not control the privacy policies or the privacy practices of any third parties.

    <strong>International Users</strong> The Site may be accessed by users located outside the United States. If you choose to use the Service from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ
    from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your personal information outside of those regions to the United States, and that by providing your personal information on or through the Site then you consent to that transfer.

<div class="ui vertical segment">
    <strong>Security Policy</strong> Access Limitations We limit access to the personal information we have about you to those employees who have a legitimate business need to access such information. In keeping with industry standards and practices,
    we maintain appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards and controls to protect your information. The Site is built upon a secure infrastructure with multiple layers of protection, and we use industry-standard encryption technologies
    to safeguard your information. Users are required to identify and authenticate themselves prior to accessing sensitive portions of the Site. Generally, identification and authentication take place through the use of your username and a password and/or
    while logging in with one of our technical support staff. Notifications of Security Systems Breach If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may
    also post a notice on or through the Site in the event of a security breach. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
</div>
<div class="ui vertical segment">
    <strong>Take Precautionary Measures</strong> You can take several precautions to protect the security of your computer and personal information. For instance, you can use a well-chosen password and restrict access to your email account. You can also
    install and regularly update antivirus and firewall software to protect your computer from external attacks by malicious users. When you are finished with a session on the Site, be sure that you log out and close the browser window. You should also
    be aware of fraudulent attempts to gain access to your account information through "phishing," whereby scammers try to bring unsuspecting people to a website by using a genuine-looking email purporting to be from a legitimate company. Sometimes, either
    in the email itself or on this fake site, scammers will ask for login information to gain access to people's accounts and withdraw their money. Realty Mogul will never send you an email asking you for your login information. In general, you can protect
    yourself against phishing by never providing personal or login information via a link contained in an email; instead, go the website directly. You might also make it a habit to check the URL of a website to be sure that it begins with the correct
    domain. In the case of Realty Mogul, you should always ensure the URL begins with https://realtymogul.com or https://www.realtymogul.com.
